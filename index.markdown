**The City of Melbourne launched an Urban Forest Strategy in August 2012. They aim to reduce the temperature in the city by planting forty-two thousand new trees by 2032. We are checking their progress almost half way through their journey.**

Due to climate change, we observe higher temperatures every year all around the world. It is a serious threat to big cities, where apart from global warming, we observe the Urban Heat Island effect. The City of Melbourne decided to make their move before it was too late and launched the Urban Forest Strategy in August 2012. One of the goals proposed in the strategy is to create a resilient, healthy, and diverse forest that will provide shade and cooling.

Today is May 2024, over 10 years after the campaign's beginning, and almost 10 years before the campaign’s end. The last decade was full of turbulences, Covid-19 being one of the most significant ones. Our research aims to discover, how well the City of Melbourne managed to stick to their plan regarding the Urban Forest Strategy. The results may be helpful to evaluate the progress of the campaign, as well as provide guidance for the cities that would like to follow Melbourne’s path.
