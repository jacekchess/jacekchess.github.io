**The City of Melbourne launched an Urban Forest Strategy in August 2012. They aim to reduce the temperature in the city by planting forty-two thousand new trees by 2032. We are checking their progress almost half way through their journey.**

Due to climate change, we observe higher temperatures every year all around the world. It is a serious threat to big cities, where apart from global warming, we observe the Urban Heat Island effect. The City of Melbourne decided to make their move before it was too late and launched the Urban Forest Strategy in August 2012. One of the goals proposed in the strategy is to create a resilient, healthy, and diverse forest that will provide shade and cooling.

To date is May 2024, over 10 years after the campaign's beginning, and almost 10 years before the campaign’s end. The last decade was full of turbulences, Covid-19 being one of the most significant ones. Our research aims to discover, how well the City of Melbourne managed to stick to their plan regarding the Urban Forest Strategy. The results may be helpful to evaluate the progress of the campaign, as well as provide guidance for the cities that would like to follow Melbourne’s path.

## Forest Diversity

One of the main threats to the urban forest that the City of Melbourne recognized is tree diseases like Dutch Elm, Myrtle Rust, or plane tree canker stain. All of them are more serious, for the forests that are dominated by one species. In the strategy from August 2012, forest diversification has a separate target, which aims to compose the urban forest of **no more than 5% of one tree species, no more than 10% of one genus, and no more than 20% of any one family**. The task is challenging, as the new trees must also have the resilience to tolerate hotter, drier conditions, and potentially also cope with major storm events. In Figure 1 we check, how well the City of Melbourne manages to progress towards diversified urban forest.

*Figure 1: Fraction of tree species (top), genera (middle), and families (bottom) compared for the 2005-2021 period. The vertical lines show when the Urban Forest campaign started, and the green areas are the strategy target for 2032 - all species, genera, and families should be inside this area by that time. We can observe constant progress in all three categories since the campaign started.*

We can easily observe, that there is one dominating family/genre/species of trees, which is the Myrtaceae family with Eucalyptuses. However, the Eucalyptus dominance has been decreasing since the start of the campaign. The City of Melbourne has planted many Acacias and Bursarias for the last decade, which resulted in more diverse green live. The campaign's progress can impress with its consistency and if the council will be able to keep up the speed of planting new, non-eucalyptus trees, they should achieve their goal by 2032. However, they will need to find another tree genre then Acacia, as there are already too many of them compared to less popular genres.
