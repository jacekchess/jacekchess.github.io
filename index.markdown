Hello! If you managed to find this page, you are a member of my family, a friend, or a recruiter. Either way, you are most welcome to visit some of my Data Science and AI projects and share your thoughts in my mailbox. In my free time, I like to express my Machine Learning ideas in short private projects, and recently I decided to organize my discoveries in a blog format. Enjoy the time spent with Data Science in a light format and feel free to revisit a page for new content!
